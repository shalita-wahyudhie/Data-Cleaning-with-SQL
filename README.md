# Data Cleaning with SQL

In this project I used SQL to clean PC games data

### About Dataset

The data used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahuldabholkar/steam-pc-games) and sourced from [STEAM](https://store.steampowered.com/).

Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront by Valve. It was launched as a software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to distributing and offering third-party game publishers' titles in late 2005.

#### Data Content
- The dataset consists of price, reviews and OS compatibility of all the games on steam (50000+)
- This dataset contains the data of only the games present on Steam store.
- The dataset doesn't contain data of DLC's or Add-On Content also present on Steam.
- The PRICE is in INR â‚¹
- ID in dataset is not the App ID in-store
